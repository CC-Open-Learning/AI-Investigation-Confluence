                    <p>The data team recommends that we initially export the data from the course as a Brightspace package if more than just the content in the ‘Content’ tab is needed. Otherwise, if just the content in the ‘Content’ tab is needed, download it as a zip file from the table of contents. This will just be for initial testing and analysis.</p><p /><p>For extracting data that is constantly changing, we recommend that the data is extracted using the Brightspace API.</p><p /><p>We believe this is best because if just the content in the ‘Content’ tab is needed initially, downloading it from the table of contents is easiest and we don’t know what the formats of the files will be in the course export options. If more data than just the content in the ‘Content’ tab is needed, the Brightspace package is best as it includes content that is specific to the Brightspace LMS, such as rubrics. For long term use when data is constantly changing, we believe that the Brightspace API is best as if we rely on having the content exported, teachers will need to export their course after every change, which is not sustainable on a large scale such as the college.</p>
