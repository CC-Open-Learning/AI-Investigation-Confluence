                    <p>The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle is a set of practices and tools to help developers build more secure software.  There are 10 key security practices that will help integrate security into each stage of the developers over development process.</p><p>Security risks and the need to mitigate them can occur at any time in the development lifecycle. Here are some ways you can help mitigate risks before they appear:</p><ul><li><p>During the design phase, ensure that the design doesn’t naturally allow attackers to easily gain unauthorized access to the workload, data, or other business assets.</p></li><li><p>While coding, ensure that the code doesn’t allow attackers to easily take control of the application so as to perform unauthorized actions that could cause harm to customers, data, employees, systems, or other business assets. Developers should also work in a secure environment that doesn’t allow attacker to do such things without the developers knowledge.</p></li><li><p>While building and deploying the product, ensure that the continuous integration and continuous deployment doesn’t allow unauthorized users to alter code and allow attackers compromise it.</p></li><li><p>When running the application, ensure the environment used to run the code follows best security practices across everything to prevent attacker from compromising and abusing the work load. This includes the adoption of well-established best practices, security baseline configurations, and more.</p></li></ul><p>All of the afore mentioned stages (design, coding, building and deploying, running) should follow Zero Trust principals; assuming there will be a breach (assume being  compromised), explicitly verifying trust, granting the lowest level of privilege that a user requires, machine/service identity, and application component.</p><p /><h2 style="text-align: center;" id="MicrosoftSecurityDevelopmentLifecycle-TenKeySecurityPractices">Ten Key Security Practices</h2><p /><ol start="1"><li><p>Establish security standards, metrics, and governance</p></li><li><p>Require use of proven security features, languages, and framework</p></li><li><p>Perform security design review and threat modeling</p></li><li><p>Define and use cryptography standards</p></li><li><p>Secure the software supply chain</p></li><li><p>Secure the engineering environment</p></li><li><p>Perform security testing</p></li><li><p>Ensure operational platform security</p></li><li><p>Implement security monitoring and response</p></li><li><p>Provide security training</p></li></ol><p />
