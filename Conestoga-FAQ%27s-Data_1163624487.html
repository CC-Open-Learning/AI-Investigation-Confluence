You don't need to bring anything, but the text suggests wearing comfortable shoes for exploring the campus. It is also encouraged to take a virtual tour before arriving, to better orient yourself while on campus. Orientation events themselves are free, but Frosh week events, hosted by Conestoga students inc., may include a fee.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Can I use my ONE Card as a transit pass?</p><ul><li><p>Yes, students registered at specific campuses who purchase a 4-month unlimited GRT term pass can use their ONE Card as a transit pass. Visit the public transit web page for more information.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When should I arrive for Convocation Ceremony?</p><ul><li><p>You should arrive 90 minutes before your designated ceremony time. It is very important to allow travel time to arrive within the registration period. If you do not register on time, you will not be able to sit with your classmates or join the ceremony until after all graduates have crossed the stage.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>What if I can't attend my mandatory Online Academic Orientation Session? Will the session be recorded?</p><ul><li><p>Yes, the mandatory Online Academic Orientation Session will be recorded and made available for those who are unable to attend the live session. You can access the recording through the student portal or by contacting your program's Student Success Advisor.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p /><p>=&gt; Wrong Answers(Hallucination):</p><ul><li><p>I am an International STudent, Can I use One Card for transit?</p><ul><li><p>Based on the context provided, international students cannot use their One Card as a transit pass. The One Card can be used as a transit pass for students registered at specific campuses who purchase a 4-month unlimited GRT term pass. Unfortunately, this benefit is not extended to international students.</p></li><li><p>The context does not provide a specific answer to this question.
