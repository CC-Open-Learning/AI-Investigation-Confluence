                    <p>This demo is aimed at showcasing our capabilities to the Large AI Committee while highlighting the commercialization potential of the generative AI chatbot we are developing. The demo is divided into Level 1 and Level 2, with the levels defined based on Sean's <a class="external-link" href="https://medium.com/@sean.yo/evolving-education-with-ai-the-digital-teaching-assistant-and-its-progression-scale-13b604b063d8" rel="nofollow">article</a>.</p><h3 id="PreparingfortheAIcommercializationdemo.-DTAScaleforAIinEducation"><strong>DTA Scale for AI in Education</strong></h3><p>The DTA (Digital Teaching Assistant) scale provides a roadmap for the progression of AI capabilities in education, similar to how the SAE scale tracks self-driving car advancements. It helps set clear expectations for integrating AI into education, from simple informational support to personalized coaching.</p><h4 id="PreparingfortheAIcommercializationdemo.-DTACognitiveAutonomyScale:">DTA Cognitive Autonomy Scale:</h4><ul><li><p>Level 0 - No DTA: No AI assistance, entirely human-managed.</p></li><li><p>Level 1 - Informational DTA: Answers transactional questions based on course content.</p></li><li><p>Level 2 - Interpretive DTA: Synthesizes course content to answer abstract questions.</p></li><li><p>Level 3 - Responsive Coaching DTA: Provides learning strategies and resource information.</p></li><li><p>Level 4 - Personal Coaching DTA: Creates interactive content, manages course load, and tailors interactions based on student needs.</p></li><li><p>Level 5 - Journey Coaching DTA: Integrates program-wide data to provide holistic advice on courses and career goals.</p></li></ul><p>The scale ensures that AI enhances learning at each level, with data playing a crucial role in customization. Responsible data usage and privacy are key for the development and deployment of DTAs.</p><h3 id="PreparingfortheAIcommercializationdemo.-Technicalflow"><strong>Technical flow</strong></h3><p>The code used in this demo is based on the work done during the S24 term. The frontend and backend were developed using Angular, while Olama Embedding was used for model embedding, and the LLM (Large Language Model) utilized is Mistral. The database used in the frontend is PostgreSQL, which manages course-related data.</p><h3 id="PreparingfortheAIcommercializationdemo.-DemoandScenarios"><strong>Demo and Scenarios</strong></h3><p>To prepare for this demo, we utilized various resources. The Level 1 demo will use Copilot Studio with a development-focused instructional plan as the dataset. For the Level 2 demo, weâ€™re using an open platform with our custom-developed CondorBot, which has been trained on program course content. This enables it to respond not only to Level 1 questions but also to more advanced Level 2 inquiries.</p><p>Detailed scenarios are as follows:</p><p><strong>Level 1 Demo Scenario</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ask the chatbot simple Level 1 questions to retrieve relevant information.</p></li><li><p>Upload a new dataset and retrieve information previously unavailable through the chatbot.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Level 2 Demo Scenario</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ask CondorBot Level 2 questions to obtain more in-depth information.</p></li></ul><p /><p><a class="external-link" href="https://medium.com/@sean.yo/evolving-education-with-ai-the-digital-teaching-assistant-and-its-progression-scale-13b604b063d8" rel="nofollow">Driving the Future of AI in Education: The Digital Teaching Assistant and Its Progression Scale | by Sean Yo +AI | Medium</a></p><p />
