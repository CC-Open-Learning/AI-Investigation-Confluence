                    <p>External links are not included in any export option.</p><p>There are three format options that you choose from to export your course from Brightspace LMS. The first is as a Brightspace Package, the second is as a Common Cartridge version 1.3, and the last is as a Thin Common Cartridge version 1.3.</p><p /><p>The Brightspace Package is the standard export format for Brightspace LMS. It contains the general content as well as Brightspace LMS specific contents such as Rubrics. This is the export format to use when creating a backup or to share the course with other Brightspace users.</p><p /><p>The Common Cartridge (version 1.3) contains only the general content, not the Brightspace LMS specific content. This is the best export format to use when you want to share courses with other colleges that use different LMSs and for OER resources.</p><p /><p>The Thin Common Cartridge (version 1.3) is a subset of the Common Cartridge (version 1.3) that contains Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) links, web links, and metadata. This export format is used when the course largely contains links to external tools.</p><p /><p>There is an option for exporting the data just from the 'Content” tab, if nothing else is needed. This will download a zip file that has web pages, pdfs, word documents, and/or mp4 files. It depends on what the professor uploads. a student is able to do this option, where as the other three options have to be done by an admin of the course.</p><p>To download only the data from the ‘Contents’ tab, go to the ‘Contents’ tab then to the Table of Contents. Beside the title will be an arrow that is facing down. Click that and select the download option. There is also a download button under the title. You can click that to download the contents as well.</p>
